This website is an experiment of sorts.
Over the last year or so, I have been playing around with [logseq](https://docs.logseq.com) as a note taking tool.
Looking for a way to better share my notes, I have found the [Schrodinger plugin](https://github.com/sawhney17/logseq-schrodinger) by Aryan Sawhney.

This is what happened next.
